### No. I am your father 👨‍👧‍👦

Hello there fellow padawans. My name is Fábio and I'm a Front-end Web Enginner at ![Toledo & Souza Engineering](https://toledoesouza.com). I like to think that I use my lightsaber and force skills to build, maintain and test the user interfaces of our products, but that is for my boss and clients to judge 🤦.

Besides that I’m currently working on my own personal webiste, and also trying to learn react testing, how to use ESLint without losing my mind, and how to better use git and not butcher my repos timeline with wild merges.
