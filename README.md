Hello there, fellow padawans. My name is Fabio and I work at [Toledo & Souza Enginnering](https://toledoesouza.com), where I use my lightsaber skills to build, maintain and test the user interfaces of our products.

I’m also into Reactjs testing, how to properly use Linters and how to better use git and stuff.
