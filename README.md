### Hello there! 🙋‍♂️

I'm a Front-end Web Enginner who enjoys the danger of juggling 🤹 his coffee, keyboard and lightsaber while trying to build user interfaces.

Besides that I’m also:
 - Working on my own personal webiste.
 - Learning React testing, how to use ESLint, and how make better use of git and not butcher my repos timeline with wild merges anymore.
